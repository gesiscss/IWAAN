# IWAAN - Interactive Wikipedia Article Analysis Notebooks (BETA)
Entirely based on interactive, repurposable and open Jupyter Notebooks (no coding needed - but code is transparent).

## Description

This interactive demonstration shows some of the ways in which data from the [WikiWho API](https://api.wikiwho.net) (together with other sources) can be used to explore article editing dynamics as well as shed light on the edit history of specific users. 

Particuarly, the notebooks it contains help in determining and expressing the impact of a Wikipedia user regarding her participation or production of knowledge in articles. The visualizations provided can be used to study the outcomes of various editing dynamics on the articles and by playing with parameters and metrics we have defined and explain, the user can uncover new patterns. 

## Features

**No coding skills needed, but code is transparent**

The demo needs no programming knowledge to be used, but offers transparency by simply masking code behind "widgets", allowing more experienced users to dive into the mechanics of the API calls and data strcutures behind it and immediately modfiy them for their own purpose. 

**Live data**

All data used comes from live systems (Wikipedia, Xtools, ORES, Wikiwho), reflecting the current article status. This is also why calculations can take some time, please be patient! (We are working on making things faster)

**Languages**
Currently, we support English and German fully, with Spanish, Basque and Turkish in "Alpha" support. 

## Getting Started with this Demo

**Instant start**

Use the [Binder link](https://notebooks.gesis.org/binder/v2/gh/gesiscss/IWAAN/master?filepath=1_General_Metadata.ipynb) to run the notebooks.  Then select the article you want to analyse. First explore the article; go through the notebooks (which will open in different tabs in your browser) in order and you will be further on be able to also inspect users more in details. 
You can switch between the various notebooks. 

**For a local installation you're going to need:**

*  Windows, Linux or OS X
*  Python version 3.6
*  Jupyter Notebook Framework

## Need Help? Found a bug?

Submit an issue to GitHub if you find one, and feel free to submit pull requests with bug fixes or changes.

## Future development

We are already working on new features, such as clustering edits together into topics, but this will take a while to reach the (more or less) stable version.
